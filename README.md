# Ongoing Practice Projects - OpenCV,NumPy

The following projects will serve as a breeding ground for uncovering different techniques using packages such as OpenCV,NumPy and others. 

The end goal is to have a working knowledge base to pull from when needed. 

This will also (hopefully) help others that are interested in learning about the technologies I plan to use. My hope is that this repo will make development alot easier for many other people as well as showcase domain specific knowledge of the technologies listed.
